# Number Classifier

This is a simple number classification app built with Python and tkinter. It allows you to train a model to classify numbers based on a reference number and predict whether a given number is higher or lower than the reference. And a somewhat nice GUI. We all like GUI's and some colors, right?ðŸ˜…âœ¨

## Requirements

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git for Desktop](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the directory of your choice, click into the address bar, type **"cmd"** and hit Enter.
2. Clone the repository with the command: `git clone https://github.com/df8819/SimpleNN.git` in the **CMD** Window.
3. Double click: **"Update.bat"**.
4. For later instances, use: **"Run.bat"**

## Features

- Reference Number (between 0 and 1): Enter a decimal number between 0 and 1. This number serves as a reference for the classification.
- Number to predict (between 0 and 1): Enter a decimal number between 0 and 1. This number will be classified as higher or lower than the reference number.
- Layers/Nodes (Brain size): Enter the number of nodes to use in each layer of the neural network. The model uses a three-layer architecture with the same number of nodes in each layer.
- 'Random number count' for training: Enter the count of random numbers to generate for training the model.
- Predict Button: Click this button to perform the prediction based on the provided inputs.
- Reset Graph Button: Click this button to clear the training progress graph.
- Note: The prediction value closer to 1 indicates a higher prediction, while closer to 0 indicates a lower prediction.

## Guide

- A simple user guide is implemented in the app itself. Click the "Guide" button for more information.

## Note:
The Number Classifier application is a simplified example and may not provide accurate predictions for complex scenarios. It is intended for learning purposes and as a starting point for further development.
